It is a habit that I wish to continue into 2021, but it is also a habit 
I desire to be more deliberate and thoughtful about going forward. 

First, I have selected the top five books I read in non-fiction and fiction during 2020. 
More than sharing my thoughts about each one, I felt that I needed to write 
a summary of each book in order to convince you why you should make these books a priority in 2021. 
I challenged myself to write only three sentences for each summary--
an exercise in restraint to kick off my year of intention. 

After each top five list, I  listed a few honorable mentions 
which would have made it onto longer lists and deserve to be read just as much as the top five. 
A chronological list of every book I read in 2020 sits at the bottom of this article.

#### Top 5 Nonfiction

**1. Pacific by Simon Winchester (2015)**
  
  Both comprehensive and regal, Simon Winchester’s *Pacific* tells a sweeping story of the Pacific Ocean 
  through ten, detailed histories. From the development of the nuclear bomb to surfing, 
  Winchester deploys unlikely narratives to discuss broader trends developing in the Pacific—mainly global warming 
  and geopolitical power balances. If aliens invaded Earth, they would appoint Winchester to tell our story.
  
**2. The Mathematical Universe by Max Tegmark (2014)**
  
  There is no bigger-picture book than Max Tegmark’s *The Mathematical Universe.* At its foundation, 
  Tegmark argues that beyond subatomic particles, mathematical structures lay at the base of our reality. 
  While I am completely unqualified to comment on the scientific merit of his theories, Tegmark’s sweeping, 
  logical creativity leads to a mind-bending exploration of multiverse theory.
  
**3. The Guns of August by Barbara W. Tuchman (1962)**
  
  *The Guns of August* expertly traces the complex web of relationships, correspondence, 
  and strategy that led to the disastrously consequential 1914. Without explicitly stating it, 
  Barbara Tuchman’s history explores the slow slide into World War I until conflict became unavoidable. 
  As such, Tuchman’s perspective on the lead up and first few months of World War I has become a definitive 
  and indispensable volume--illuminating that even though we may fight back, we are all mere instruments of history.
  
**4. The Perfect Weapon by David E. Sanger (2018)**
  
  From Bush to Obama, David E. Sanger employs his diligent reporting to explain the rapid rise of geopolitical, 
  cybersecurity concerns in *The Perfect Weapon.* In chapters covering attacks from North Korea, China, and Russia, 
  Sanger underscores the abundantly varied capabilities exploited by foreign agents. And through uncovering 
  the United States’ own cybersecurity operations and strategies, Sanger rails against the secrecy surrounding 
  cybersecurity and argues that transparency is the only way to begin closing the Pandora’s box of the information age.
  
**5. The Shortest History of Germany by James Hawes (2017)**
  
  Tracing German history from the Romans to Angela Merkel, Hawes’ *The Shortest History of Germany* is as readable as a breezy, 
  Sunday afternoon. Thoroughly researched, Hawes’ synthesizes the work of various German studies scholars 
  to argue that German history is a constant battle of power between the people West and East of the Elbe. 
  My only complaint—I wish it were longer.
