I broadly study theories of power, with a specific focus on the relationship between power and digital technology as well as the power of futures.

### Features
* On my blog, you can find all of my non-academic writing.
* On my projects page, you can find where my work has been featured along with any alt-ac escapades. 
* I occasionally write in Spanish when the topic calls for it, but those works can also be found translated into English.

### Inspiration
This website is hosted using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The initial template for this site is [Balzac](https://github.com/ColeTownsend/Balzac-for-Jekyll), but I adapted it to fit my style and needs. The current design is inspired by [Peter Mendelsund's](https://www.petermendelsund.com/) collection of [Italo Calvino book covers](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/119677.Italo_Calvino_Harcourt_Peter_Mendelsund_Covers_).
